# AWS Serverless MCP Server

## Overview

The AWS Serverless Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is an open-source tool that combines AI assistance with serverless expertise to streamline how developers build serverless applications. It provides contextual guidance specific to serverless development, helping developers make informed decisions about architecture, implementation, and deployment throughout the entire application development lifecycle. With AWS Serverless MCP, developers can build reliable, efficient, and production-ready serverless applications with confidence.

Key benefits of the Serverless MCP Server include:
- AI-powered serverless development: Provides rich contextual information to AI coding assistants to ensure your serverless application aligns with AWS best practices.
- Comprehensive tooling: Offers tools for initialization, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting of serverless applications.
- Architecture guidance: Helps evaluate design choices and select optimal serverless patterns based on application needs. Offers recommendations on event sources, function boundaries, and service integrations.
- Operational best practices: Ensures alignment with AWS architectural principles. Suggests effective use of AWS services for event processing, data persistence, and service communication, and guides implementation of security controls, performance tuning, and cost optimization.
- Security-first approach: Implements built-in guardrails with read-only defaults and controlled access to sensitive data.
